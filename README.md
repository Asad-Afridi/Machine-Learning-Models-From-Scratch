# Machine Learning Models From Scratch

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Models From Scratch** repository! This project aims to provide implementations of various machine learning algorithms from the ground up, using Python and NumPy. The goal is to enhance understanding of how these algorithms work internally, allowing users to appreciate the mechanics behind popular machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Implementations of key machine learning algorithms
- Detailed documentation and examples for each model
- Clear and concise code structure for easy understanding
- NumPy-based for efficient computations

## Models Implemented

This repository includes the following machine learning models:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asad-Afridi/Machine-Learning-Models-From-Scratch.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Machine-Learning-Models-From-Scratch
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. You may want to create a virtual environment for this:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Usage

You can use the implemented models by importing the necessary classes into your Python scripts. For example:

```python
from linear_regression import LinearRegression

# Create a model instance
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model on your data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

Make sure to check the respective model files for more detailed usage instructions and examples.
